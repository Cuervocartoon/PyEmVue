# PyEmVue

A Python Library for reading data from the Emporia Vue energy monitoring system.

Currently a WIP in the API documenting and initial implementation phase. The library can be invoked directly to pull back some basic info but requires your email and password to be added to a keys.json file.

API documentation can be [accessed here](api_docs.md)

```json
{
    "email": "you@email.com",
    "password": "password"
}
```
